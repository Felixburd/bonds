# Interactive Cellular Ecosystem

A web-based particle simulation that creates emergent cellular-like behaviors through particle interactions, clustering, and bonding.

## Features
- Dynamic particle states (static, dynamic, aggressive, cluster)
- Particle bonding and clustering behaviors
- Energy-based state transitions
- Interactive drag and energy burst mechanics
- Optimized spatial partitioning for performance
- Elastic boundary behaviors
- Color themes based on particle states

## Usage
Open `index.html` in a web browser to run the simulation.
- Click and drag to interact with particles
- Use the "Add Energy Burst" button to inject energy into the system
- Use the "Reset" button to restart the simulation

## Technical Details
- Pure JavaScript implementation
- HTML5 Canvas for rendering
- Optimized for 3000+ particles
- Spatial partitioning for efficient neighbor detection
